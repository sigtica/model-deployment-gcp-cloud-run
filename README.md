# Model Deployment Using Cloud Run on Google Cloud Platform

This is the module for model deployment to GCP Cloud Run using the Gunicorn framework with support for multi-threading.

## Getting started

To get started, simply copy the repo to GCP Cloud Shell or somewhere else where you have the gcloud SDK installed. 

Then in shell, simply type:
```shell
bash start.sh
```
to both build the image and to deploy the service on GCP Cloud Run.


## Support 

This template uses Google Cloud Platform's [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs) and [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying) features. Please see GCP's documentation for more details.
